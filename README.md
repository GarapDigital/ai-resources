## Frameworks
- CrewAI — Orchestrates multiple agents working together. Ideal for tasks that need coordination and role-based behavior.
- Agno — Focuses on memory, tool use, and long-term interactions. Great for assistants that need to remember and adapt.
- Camel — Designed for multi-agent collaboration, simulation, and task specialization.
- AutoGPT — Automates complex workflows with a loop of planning and execution. Best for agents that need to run independently.
- AutoGen—Lets agents communicate with each other to solve complex problems.
- SuperAGI — Streamlined setup for building and shipping autonomous agents fast.
- Superagent — A flexible open-source toolkit to create custom AI assistants.
- LangChain & LlamaIndex — The go-to tools for managing memory, retrieval, and toolchains.

## Vertical Agents
- Gurubase - Gurubase lets you add an "Ask AI" button to your technical docs, turning your content into an AI assistant.
